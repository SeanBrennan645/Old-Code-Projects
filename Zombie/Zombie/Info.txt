You are on an island surrounded by zombies.
You must survive until all the zombies are killed and avoid
manholes and the surrounding nuclear radiation.

If a zombie falls in a manhole it will die.
There are also other trapped survivors on the island
if you can reach and save them before they are eaten
they will join your group.
If a zombie lands on you, you will die, however
if you have other survivors in your group one will
sacrfice themselves to kill the zombie and allow
you and your group to stay alive.
Be careful as zombies may group up on the same position
and appear to just be one but could in fact be a hoard.
Zombies will move after you do, at first they will move
randomly but after half of them are killed they will
be able to smell you and begin to follow you if you get too
close.

You start off with a set amount of points depending on
the map size and difficulty you select.
Every move you take you will lose 100 points, if
your score reaches 0 you  will die from starvation
On easy mode you gain 100 points for each zombie that dies
and 200 points on hard mode.
If you survive you will recieve a winners bonus, but
if you lose you will recieve a penalty depending on how
you died.
You also recieve 250 points each time you save a survivor.
